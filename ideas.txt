Logging:
 - Store initial state
 - Keep track of all actions (in a tree?)
 - Seek backward in time (undo)
 - Branch forward in time (explore branches)
 - Review/dissect a game
 - Try out different moves

Serialization format:
 - Persist logs across sessions

Async for network play:
 - Make trait async, I guess?

CLI:
 - Minimum: multiple-commands, tab complete, docs

TUI:
 - Ratatui, with full layout
 - Menu buttons
 - Interactive scrolly tree for modifying history.

If the tree shows everything, need more space.
Scrolly tree, select any non-terminal node to edit.
"Take control" of that user's perspective.
Don't rotate.
